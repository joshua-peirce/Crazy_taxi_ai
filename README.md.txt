Crazy Taxi AI was created as a proof-of-concept in fundamentals of computer science 1 class. It  was a challenge to see if I could make something impressive like a genetic algorithm - the most rudimentary form of machine learning - in beginning student language in Racket. Racket was my first purely functional language, and being in the restricted "beginning student" environment, everything had to be done manually, thus the code is very verbose. 

Crazy Taxi is a game I originally played on CoolMath where you were a taxi driving down a 3-lane road and some other cars would come at you, and you had to try and dodge them. In the original game you could jump over them or go beside them; in my version, I removed the ability to jump, and just made it so that there was always a gap for you to fit through.

As it was originally a passion project, I wasn't religious about documenting every function. I have tried to go back and correct this now, but there may be some places I missed. 

All in all it took about 25 hours to get to a working state, and I'm proud of how it came out. This was completed September-October of 2021.
